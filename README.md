## üìå Architecture Overview

- **VPC** with public and private subnets
- **Internet Gateway** for external access
- **NAT Gateway** to allow private instances outbound internet access (for updates)
- **Public Application Load Balancer (ALB)** receives external traffic
- **Proxy EC2 Instances** (Nginx) in public subnets forward traffic to:
- **Private Application Load Balancer (ALB)** handling internal routing
- **Apache EC2 Instances** in private subnets serve the final content
- **Security Groups** control traffic and ensure isolation
- **Key Pair** generated via Terraform for SSH access
- **S3 Bucket** used for storing backend state (optional)
